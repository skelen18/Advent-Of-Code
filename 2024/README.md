As of **December 8th, 2024**, I have completed **8 out of 25 puzzles**.  

## How It Works
Each day, a new puzzle is unlocked on the Advent of Code website. These puzzles include two parts, and solving both earns a star ⭐ for that day. Successfully completing all puzzles results in a complete holiday-themed image.

## Holiday Image 🎨
Once all puzzles are solved, the final holiday image from Advent of Code will appear below:
