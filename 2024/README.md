As of **December 4th, 2024**, I have completed **4 out of 25 puzzles**.  

## How It Works
Each day, a new puzzle is unlocked on the Advent of Code website. These puzzles include two parts, and solving both earns a star ⭐ for that day. Successfully completing all puzzles results in a complete holiday-themed image.

## Holiday Image 🎨
Once all puzzles are solved, the final holiday image from Advent of Code will appear below:

### Running the Code
To test a solution for a specific day:
1. Navigate to the folder for that day (`Day01`, `Day02`, etc.).
2. Run the `solution.py` script using Python:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
