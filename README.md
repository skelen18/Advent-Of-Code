# Advent of Code ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** repository! This is where I store my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is a programming event held every December. Each day, from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released. These puzzles are fun, engaging, and cover a wide range of algorithmic and logical challenges.

The event is an excellent way to:
- Practice coding skills.
- Learn new programming concepts.
- Solve interesting problems with a holiday twist.

## My Approach
- All solutions in this repository are implemented in **Python**.
- My solutions are not necessarily the most optimized or elegant. Instead, they reflect my **first working idea** for each puzzle.
- The main goal is to enjoy solving the puzzles, improve my skills, and learn something new.

ðŸŽ… **Happy Coding and Happy Holidays!**
